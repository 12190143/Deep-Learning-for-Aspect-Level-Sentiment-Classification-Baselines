## Introduction of this work
### models/:  The deep learning model for ASC
 - ContextAvg: the average of the word embeddings is fed to a softmax layer for sentiment prediction, which was adopted as a baseline in [1].
 - AEContextAvg: the concatenation of the average of the word embeddings and the average of the aspect vectors is fed to a softmax layer for sentiment prediction, which was adopted as a baseline in [1].
 - LSTM: the last hidden vector obtained by LSTM [2] is used for sentence representation and sentiment prediction. 
 - GRU: the last hidden vector obtained by GRU [3] is used for sentence representation and sentiment prediction.
 - BiLSTM: the concatenation of last hidden vectors obtained by BiLSTM is used for sentence representation and sentiment prediction.
 - BiGRU: the concatenation of last hidden vectors obtained by BiGRU is used for sentence representation and sentiment prediction.
 - TD-LSTM: a target-dependent LSTM model which modeled the preceding and following contexts surrounding the target for sentiment classification [4].
 - TC-LSTM: this model extends TD-LSTM by incorporating an target con- nection component, which explicitly utilizes the connections between target word and each context word when composing the representation of a sentence. [4].
 - AT-LSTM: it uses an LSTM to model the sentence and a basic attention mechanism is applied for sentence representation and sentiment prediction. [5].
 - AT-GRU: it uses a GRU to model the sentence and a basic attention mechanism is applied for sentence representation and sentiment prediction. [5].
 - AT-BiLSTM: it uses a BiLSTM to model the sentence and a basic attention mechanism is applied for sentence representation and sentiment prediction. [5].
 - AT-BiGRU: it uses a BiGRU to model the sentence and a basic attention mechanism is applied for sentence representation and sentiment prediction. [5].
 - ATAE-LSTM: the aspect representation is integrated into attention-based LSTM for sentence representation and sentiment prediction [5].
 - ATAE-GRU: the aspect representation is integrated into attention-based GRU for sentence representation and sentiment prediction.
 - ATAE-BiLSTM: the aspect representation is integrated into attention-based BiLSTM for sentence representation and sentiment prediction.
 - ATAE-BiGRU: the aspect representation is integrated into attention-based BiGRU for sentence representation and sentiment prediction.
 - IAN: the attentions in the context and aspect were learned interactively for context and aspect representation [6]. 
 - LCRS: it contains three LSTMs, i.e., left-, center- and right- LSTM, respectively modeling the three parts of a review (left context, aspect and right context) [7].
 - CNN: The sentence representation obtained by CNN [8] is used for ASC.
 - GCAE: it has two separate convolutional layers on the top of the embedding layer, whose outputs are combined by gating units [9].
 - MemNet: the content and position of the aspect is incorporated into a deep memory network [10].
 - RAM: a multi-layer architecture where each layer contains an attention-based aggregation of word features and a GRU cell to learn the sentence representation [11]. 
 - CABASC: two novel attention mechanisms, namely sentence-level content attention mechanism and context attention mechanism are introduced in a memory network to tackle the semantic-mismatch problem [12].
